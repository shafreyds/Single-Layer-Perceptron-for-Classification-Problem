# Single-Layer-Perceptron-for-Classification-Problem
Implementing a Single layer for Classification Problem

This code defines a perceptron function that takes as input the training data, learning rate, and number of iterations. It initializes the weights and bias to zero, and then trains the model by updating the weights and bias based on the error between the predicted and actual labels. The function returns the trained weights and bias.

The code then creates a random binary classification dataset and trains the perceptron on it using the perceptron function. Finally, it makes predictions on a new set of data and prints the predicted labels to the console.
